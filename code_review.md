## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Very readable and easy to follow
- Nice use of python functions, with docstrings! -- in future projects these can be moved to separate .py modules and imported to make notebooks even cleaner :)

## Good Documentation:

- README.md brief; only contains project introduction
- Great use of markdown cells for section headings and explanations of thought process
- Decisions made were clearly stated and backed by data exploration

## Proper Data Science:

- Great integration of locations dataset not only for lat/long info, but for identification & handling of duplicate stations, and innovative use of character set partial matching for the same!
- Demonstration of good Python understanding and a good command of Pandas
- Nice scatter plot of traffic by lat/long
- Great depth of data analysis for different purposes/filters

## Comments:

- Great work on project 1! :)
- I was impressed by the logical flow of the EDA
- Use the README.md file sort of like an abstract to a research project -- outline your goal, methods, summary of results, tools used, explanations of the what the different files in the repo are and in what order to explore them, and the names of members who worked on the project.
